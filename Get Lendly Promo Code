A payday loan is a short term loan which is provided in return for a post-dated cheque. The post dated cheque would be made payable on the date of your next pay day or maybe the following one. You can either arrange to pay the loan off in full before the due date on the cheque or alternatively allow the cheque to be presented. A payday loan really is an emergency loan when you just do not have the funds to make it through until your next payday. Very often it is some emergency that just has to be paid, example a new heating boiler.

There are some obvious benefits of using a Payday loan in this manner, particularly if you consider the alternatives.

1. - There are fees for a payday loan but costs are probably less than the additional bank charges incurred for exceeding an overdraft limit or the cost of exceeding the credit limit on a credit card or incurring late payment penalty charges.

2. - Payday loans don't affect your credit status because the companies that provide payday loans don't report the information through the channels as other conventional lenders would.
